At the heart of this transformation are robust, well-designed Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) that enable automated trading strategies to connect efficiently with diverse market venues, access real-time data, and execute orders programmatically. In this proposal, we present a comprehensive team-based academic project aimed at designing and implementing a flexible, object-oriented trading API—focusing sharply on architectural patterns (API gateways), generic connectivity, flight search as an illustrative data model, and critical mechanisms such as throttling (rate limiting) and authentication.\nThis proposal targets students and developers interested in understanding modern API-driven systems, integrating the principles of object-oriented programming (OOP). We emphasize how OOP supports scalable, maintainable, and extensible APIs—capable of supporting algorithmic trading and adaptable to broader data domains such as travel aggregation. The approach will utilize current industry best practices, integrate wide-ranging academic and technical sources, and provide a roadmap to implementation, teamwork, and testing.\nObjectives\nOur project will address the following main objectives:\n1. Access financial data through API\n\n    •\tFor now, we will adhere to Finnhub Stock APIs, as they have a detailed API documentation and its basic functionality is free to use\n\n    •\tThey have their own error handling schemes, so we will stick to it\n\n    •   [Finnhub API documentation](https://finnhub.io/docs/api/introduction)\n\n2. Thorough Exploratory Data Analysis\n\n    •   Since we are most likely to deal with time-series data, some econometrics will play significant role\n\n    •   In addition, it is ideal to visualize data in some other forms (histogram, heatmap, etc.), which we will figure out\n\n3. Develop trading strategy\n\n    •   Further details to be discussed\n\n4. Backtest\n\n    •   TBD",

With aporiximately equal weighted tasks, we assured that each team member may contribute to the project.\n\n### Challenges & Problems\n\nThe Biggest challenge we encountered so far was that we were haeding to a wrong direction. Initially, we thought the main goal of this project was to build our own API, and we assigned task based on this misconception.\nThus, we were not able to really put effective effort on this project and we had to demolish everything we built up after we figured out this strategis mistake.\nAnother issue, which may be minimal or significant, is that most functionality of Finnhub API are not free to use, so if we want to continue use it for free, we may encounter some issues",
