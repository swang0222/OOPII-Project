Role 1: The "Security & Filtering" Lead: 汪

This person is responsible for checking every incoming request before it hits the main application logic.
    
    Primary Components: Authentication & API Throttling
    
    Core Responsibilities:
    
        Implement the IAuthService interface.
        
        Implement the IRateLimiter interface.
        
        Create a "token bucket" or "sliding window" algorithm for the rate limiter.
        
        Create a simple in-memory "database" (like a Map) to store users and their generated API keys.
    
    Key Classes to Build:
    
        AuthService (implements IAuthService)
        
        RateLimiter (implements IRateLimiter)
        
        User (a simple data class)

Role 2: The "Backend & Data Model" Lead：刘

This person is responsible for all the "business logic" and the data structures that the API uses. They build the actual trading simulation.

    Primary Components: Generic Connectivity & Data Models
    
    Core Responsibilities:
    
        Implement the IConnector interface by building a mock broker.
        
        Design and build all data-model classes.
        
        Simulate the "flight search" (i.e., getMarketData) by generating or returning fake stock data.
        
        Simulate order execution (i.e., submitOrder).
    
    Key Classes to Build:
    
        MockBrokerConnector (implements IConnector)
        
        MarketDataQuery (your "flight search" model: symbol, startDate, etc.)
        
        PriceBar (the data you return: open, high, low, close, timestamp)
        
        TradeOrder (abstract base class)

        MarketOrder, LimitOrder (concrete classes inheriting from TradeOrder)

Role 3: The "Gateway & Integration" Lead：Tim

This person builds the main entry point and is responsible for putting all the pieces together. They are the "customer" of the other two team members.
    
    Primary Components: API Gateway (Facade Pattern) & Final Integration
    
    Core Responsibilities:
    
    Build the APIGateway class.
    
        Use Dependency Injection to "plug in" the IAuthService, IRateLimiter, and IConnector interfaces.
        
        Write the core logic for each public gateway method (check auth, check throttle, then call connector).
        
        Write the final Main.java or main.py that boots up the entire application and demonstrates it working.
        
    Key Classes to Build:
    
        APIGateway (the facade)
        
        Main (the final runnable program)
