# Step 1: Key Classes to Build in order:
  Build all data models in this step
  1. MarketDataQuery (This object represents the user's request for data)
  2. PriceBar (This object represents a single piece of data returned from a query)
  3. TradeOrder (abstract base class)
  4. MarketOrder, LimitOrder (concrete classes inheriting from TradeOrder)
  5. OrderReceipt(This is the simple object you return after a user submits an order)

# Step 2: Implement the IConnector interface:
  Build the engine that uses the data models, which is MockBrokerConnector (implements IConnector)
  1. getMarketData(MarketDataQuery query)
  2. submitOrder(TradeOrder order)
  3. getAccountInfo(String apiKey)
